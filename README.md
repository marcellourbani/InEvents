InEvents
========
Internations ( http://www.internations.org ) is a social network for expatriates.
Among other things they organize events around the world.
This project is a native android application which aims to make it easier to manage them.

Features:
-synchronize events on a calendar
-provide easy access to main event details
-RSVP and maps integration without accessing the website
-Quick access to the event pages with an integrated browser

It still has several known bugs, but I'm not sure I'll fix them anytime soon: is good enough for my purpose.
